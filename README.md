# interpretable-DL4BGP
This project aims to discuss the importance of interpretability tools in machine learning models for the real-time prediction of blood glucose levels.
To run the main analysis:
- create a folder "data";
- download the OhioT1DM dataset that is available at http://smarthealth.cs.ohio.edu/OhioT1DM-dataset.html;
- create .txt files named 'ohio(patID)\_Training.txt' and 'ohio(patID)\_Testing.txt' for the training and test set, respectively;
- each .txt file should contains the following variables:
    - Time (dd-MMM-yyyy hh:mm:ss);
    - CGM (mg/dL);
    - basal_insulin (U/h) and bolus_insulin (U).
